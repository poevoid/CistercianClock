# CistercianClock
Decorative clock display

Uses the adafruit matrixportal m4 and 64x32 rgb matrix to display the time in cistercian numerics

Cistercian is a centuries old numeric system that allows you to write up to 4-digit numbers using a single symbol or space. 

This display is meant mostly just to look interesting, but should things go right, it'll be able to tell the time, too!
